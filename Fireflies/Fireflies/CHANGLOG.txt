- minim object for sound playback.
- player object to load and loop the background sound.
- backgroundImage variable that stores the loaded background image.
- customCursor variable that stores the loaded custom mouse cursor image.
- Loop to initialize the fireflies' positions, velocities, and colors based on the user input.
- lights() and noStroke() functions for rendering.
- Displaying the background image using image() function.
- Displaying the custom mouse cursor using cursor() function.
- Sound playback using player.loop().

## 2023-05-17

### Added

- Comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the code sections.
- Clarified the purpose and behavior of the fireflies, background, and mouse cursor in the program.
- Comments to explain the usage and parameters of the Eye class.
- Comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the update() and draw() methods.

## 2023-05-18

### Added

- A new class Eye to represent a wild animal eye with various features.
- Variables to store the position, size, colors, iris, and pupil properties of the eye.
- A constructor to initialize the eye object with the provided parameters.
- An update() method to update the state of the eye based on the mouse position.
- Code to calculate the offset for the iris based on the mouse position.
- Code to gradually adjust the iris offset towards the target offset using a smoothing factor.
- Code to calculate the position of the pupil based on the iris offset.
- Code to smooth the pupil position using interpolation.

## 2023-05-19

### Added

- A draw() method to render the eye on the screen.
- Code to draw the white part of the eye using an ellipse with the provided outer color.
- Code to draw the black part of the eye using an ellipse with the provided inner color.


## 2023-05-20

- Implemented the resizing of the background image to fit the canvas size.
- Added the custom mouse cursor image and positioned it at the current mouse coordinates.
- Updated the eye objects by calling the update() and draw() methods.
- Hid the default mouse cursor.
- Calculated the distance between the mouse cursor and the fireflies in 3D space.
- Normalized the direction vector from the fireflies to the mouse cursor.
- Applied a scaled force to the velocity vector of each firefly based on the direction.
- Updated the position of each firefly based on its new velocity vector.


### Added

- Added the rendering of fireflies using the sphere() function.

- Added the logic to Check if fireflies went outside the screen and reset their position and velocity accordingly.

## 2023-05-21

-Scale the direction vector by a constant force, determining the force to be applied to each firefly.
-Apply the calculated force to the velocity vector of each firefly.
-Update the velocity of each firefly by adding the force components.

### Added

- A new function mousePressed() to handle the mouse button press event.
- The calculation for the position of the mouse cursor relative to the center of the screen.
- The calculation for the direction vector from each firefly to the mouse cursor.
- normalization for the direction vector, converting it into a unit vector.
- The calculation for the distance between each firefly and the mouse cursor using the Euclidean distance formula.
